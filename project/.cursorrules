# Project Configuration for React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

## Template Information
This project uses the bolt-vite-react-ts template with the following stack:
- Vite for build tooling
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

## Design Guidelines
For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

## Technology Stack
By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

## Icon Usage
Use icons from lucide-react for logos and UI elements.

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props and data structures
